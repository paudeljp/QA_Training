'''Arthematic Operator'''
# Addition: +
# Subtraction: -
# Multiplication: *
# Exponent: **
# Division: /
# Floor Division: //
# Remainder: %

'''we can use +,-,*,/ to perform arthematic operation'''
x = 5
result = x + 10
print(result)

'''lets use ** '''
x = 5
result = x ** 2
print(result)
'''we get result 25 because 5*5 is 25'''

'''using quotient and remainder'''
x = 5
quotient = x // 2
remainder = x % 2
print("quotient is:", quotient, "remainder is:", remainder)
# result is quotient = 2 and remainder = 1

'''using assignment operator'''
x = 5
x += 10  # x = x + 10
x -= 10  # x = x - 10

'''We use Equals operator (=) assigns the value in the right to the variable in the left.'''
'''We use Arithmetic operators to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, etc.'''
'''If we use the +operator with strings, it concatenates two strings.'''
'''To Make our code more readable, we can use the parentheses. For example, 34*(5-15)'''
