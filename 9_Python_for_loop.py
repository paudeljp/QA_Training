Loops are used in programming to repeat a block of code.
'''
'''
A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence.
'''
'''
if we know the number of iterations of the loop, it's easier and better to use the for loop.
'''
'''
range() is a useful function that creates a sequence of numbers. It's common to use range() in a for loop to iterate 
the loop a certain number of times.
